# INT-LLM
In-band Network Telemetry (INT) is an efficient network monitoring technology that can collect traffic and device status information in real-time. By leveraging source routing techniques and path planning, INT can specify the forwarding paths of data packets to achieve comprehensive measurement coverage across the entire network topology. Efficient path planning algorithms are at the heart of INT's network-wide telemetry. However, existing path planning algorithms exhibit limitations in flexibility and robustness when faced with diverse requirements. This paper introduces INT-LLM, a novel intent-driven path planning algorithm based on Large Language Models (LLM), aimed at enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of path planning. The algorithm translates user intents into path planning parameters through natural language interaction, combining the efficiency of traditional algorithms with the flexibility of LLMs to rapidly generate INT path planning solutions. This study represents the first introduction of LLM for INT path planning, establishing datasets for data center network topologies and user intents, and experimentally evaluating the performance of INT-LLM. Results show that the normalized score of INT-LLM is approximately 10.39% higher than the highest score among other algorithms, demonstrating its superior performance in various telemetry tasks.
